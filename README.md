# 3D-Renderer-for-4D-Objects

For the final compiled project with more extensive data analysis and the dissertation check out [https://github.com/JoeSubbi/Investigation-into-4D-Shapes](https://github.com/JoeSubbi/Investigation-into-4D-Shapes)

## About the project

This is a research project into finding effective ways of representing and teaching others about 4 Dimensional geometry.

The goal of the project is to improve peoples understanding of a 4th spacial dimension that cannot be visualised through a series of tasks and explanations.

## `Planning & progress/`

A series of markdown documents detailing the time spent and progress made on the project.

## `Experiments/`

A unity project focusing on experimenting with 4D shapes, rotation mechanics and user interaction

## `4D Shapes/`

A unity project containing polished interfaces and representations that will build the final application for users to interact with.

The project will eventual showcase a series of tasks and videos to teach and test a user on their understanding of 4 Dimensional Geometry.

## `Shape Descriptions and Derivations`

A series of descriptions and derivations for *Signed Distance Functions* (SDFs) used in the ray marching project.

This is incomplete with more shapes to come.

This directory will also contain videos that explain 4D shapes and why they behave the way they do.
