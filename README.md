# 3D-Renderer-for-4D-Objects

## About the project

This is a research project into finding effective ways of representing and teaching others about 4 Dimensional geometry.

The goal of the project is to improve peoples understanding of a 4th spacial dimension that cannot be visualised through a series of tasks and explanations.

## `Planning & progress/`

A series of markdown documents detailing the time spent and progress made on the project.

## `Ray Marcher/`

A unity project that will eventual showcase a series of tasks and videos to teach and test a user on their understanding of 4 Dimensional Geometry.

Currently There are a series of shaders that utilising ray marching to visualise cross sections of 3D and 4D shapes.

## `Shape Descriptions and Derivations`

A series of descriptions and derivations for *Signed Distance Functions* (SDFs) used in the ray marching project.

This is incomplete with more shapes to come.

This directory will also contain videos that explain 4D shapes and why they behave the way they do.
