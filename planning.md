# Tasks

## Define the shape

Given a 4D shape in a random pose and allowing the user to play around with it for an allotted time, can the user correctly determine what the shape is?

## Match the pose

Given an Active shape on one side of the screen and a Target shape on the other side of the screen in a random pose, can the user manipulate the Active shape such that it matches the pose of the Target shape.

# Representations

## Onion Skin

A central object with a translucent blue and red 3D "slice" overlaying a slice in the +W and -W direction, directly in line with the central object.

## W Axis timeline

A central object adjacent to 1 or more +W and -W "slices" on the right and left of the center object respectively.

## 3D representation of the 4D object

Have a 3D shape that is similar to the displayed 4D object - i.e a hyper cube and a cube - that rotates along x, y, and z, with the wx, wy, and wz rotation respectively.
