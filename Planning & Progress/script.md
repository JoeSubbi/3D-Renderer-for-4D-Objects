# Introduction
## 4D Shapes

**Geometry**
As I am sure you know, 3D Euclidean space is made up of 3 axes; x, y and z.
In 4D we have 4 axes, x, y, z and w. it is impossible to imagine, but the w axis is perpendicular to x and y and z, in the same way that z is perpendicular to x and y.

To begin understanding 4D shapes, it is best to start with 3D examples.

Take a 3D sphere:

If we take a 2D slice at the center of that sphere, you can see it appears as a circle.

As I said before 3D space is described with 3 axes, x y and z. In this example, we take y to be up. In this case, the cross section covers a slice along the z axis and spans the x, y plane.

If we move that sphere, along the z axis, through the translucent plane, you can see the 2D circle changes size.

Now we will take a 3D Cube:

If we move this cube through the plane, you can see it actually remains the same shape. That is until we get so far that the shape is no longer within the slice and disappears.

Moving on to 4D: 

Here we are taking a 3D cross section of a 4 Dimensional object, in this case a hyper sphere.

If we move the sphere forward or backward along the W axis, you can see it appears as a sphere that shrinks and expands, very similar to the 2D cross section of the 3D sphere.

If we now take the 4D hyper cube, also known as a tesseract, you can see it also behaves very similarly when we move it along the W axis as to when we moved a 3D cube along the Z axis.

**Rotation**
Moving on to 4D rotation.

I am sure you are used to thinking of rotation as "rotating about an axis". For the sake of understand 4D rotation, you will need to adapt your understanding slightly. 

Instead: consider that we rotate an object around a plane.
In 3D this would make rotating about the Y axis, equivalent to rotating about the XZ plane.

You can think of the rotation as rotating 1 axis towards another. So XZ rotation would be rotating from X to Z.

the 3 degrees of rotation in 3D would then be YZ, XZ, XY rather than X, Y and Z respectively.

Now In 4D there are 6 degrees of rotation. The regular, Y to Z, X to Z, X to Y, plus X to W, Y to W and Z to W.

Whilst you should think of rotation in terms of rotating about a plane, it can help to keep axial rotation in mind. XW rotation can be similar to YZ rotation, and YZ rotation is equivalent to rotation about the X axis.

Lets look at the rotation of a cube in all 6 degrees of rotation.

If we take a look at the 2D cross section of the 3D cube, we can get a hint at what will happen in 4D.

When rotating the cube along the XZ plane we can see the cross section looks like it gets wider and thinner.

Now when we rotate the hyper cube along the XW plane, we can see it does more or less the same thing.

If we rotate along multiple axes in 3D you can see it gets a bit confusing,
but it is still similar to that in 4D

## The Experiment
<!--
Explain the series of tests
 - repeat the same tests 3 times for 3 different representations
 - Tests:
   - 1st - shape identification
     - given a shape that is randomly oriented, 
       can you tell me what that shape is?
     - 2 mins per shape
   - 2nd - rotation identification
     - given a shape that is rotating, can you tell me what plane 
       or planes of rotation the object is rotating around
     - 2 mins per shape
   - 3rd - matching an objects orientation
     - Given a randomly oriented object, can you match the objects 
       pose
     - Try get as close as possible before submitting
     - 6 mins per shape
 - Representations:
   - 3D to 4D
     - A 3D object in the bottom left that mimics XW, YW and ZW
       rotation by rotating on YZ, XZ and XY planes respectively
   - W axis Timeline
     - The central cross section is the focus of attention, but
       either side of the white object are red and blue objects, cross sections of the shape shape but stepped +/- 0.4 and +/- 0.8 into
       the 4th dimension, the further away from the central object it is
   - Multi-Rotational view of 4D object
     - In the top left is the regular 4D object.
     - On the right is the same object but viewed at a 90deg angle on the 
       XW plane
     - Under that, in the bottom right is the same object as the top left
       but rotated on the YW plane
     - To the left of that, in the bottom left is the same object as the   
       top left but rotated on the ZW plane
 - Texture
   - Through each test the object may be coloured in a different way.
     - diffuse lighting
     - normal representation
     - texture mapped letters

 - Measurements
   - You will be measured on your speed and your accuracy but take your time. 
   - After testing each representation you will be shown your updated statistics.
   - BTS
     - Average for Representation:
       - Time to submit
         - normalised to max time per task
       - Accuracy
         - 0% OR 100% if select from options
         - 0% TO 100% for pose matching

## Survey 2
<!--
Note down anything you think you may not understand fully or think may be a challenge
