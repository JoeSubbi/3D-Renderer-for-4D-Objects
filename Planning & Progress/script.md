# Format
<!-- 
Same format for every test, but randomly give each user 1 specific representation and method of interaction

Representations to include
 - timeline
 - each rotational view of the 4th dimension
 - 3D rotation view with 4D object

 - 3D counter part to experiment with? Will it showcase that they have learnt if they have direct reference?

Interactions to include
 - swipe
 - grab ball
-->


# Survey 1
<!-- 
What way do you think
 - the different ways of thinking
 - do they think in a geometric way?

Have you heard of 4D shapes
-->

# Introduction
## 4D Shapes
<!-- 
Defining a shape
 - each new axis is perpendicular to all other axes
 - you cannot visualise a 4th perpendicular axis

Geometry
What is a sphere? -> 3D -> 4D
What is a box? -> 3D -> 4D

Rotation
Explain properties of taking a 2D cross section of a 3D shape
Show similarity of taking a 3D cross section of a 4D 
Sphere -> 3D -> 4D
Box -> 3D -> 4D
-->

## The Experiment
<!--
Explain the series of tests
Rights as a participant
-->

## Survey 2
<!--
Note down anything you think you may not understand fully or think may be a challenge
-->

# Identify the shape
## Experiment
<!-- 
Shape List:
Sphere
Cone - extending into w
Cone - extending into y
Capsule
Box
torus - r1 in xy plane
torus - r1 in xw plane
Pentachoron
Have each shape start at a random w with multiple chances for each shape to repeat?

Given an un-rotated shape, move the hyper plane to identify the shape
Present all shapes as options. Give 30 seconds or 1 minute per shapes.
Select button to choose the shape, submit button the end the timer early.

Ask about their confidence after each shape. - avoid saying if they are right or wrong to avoid effecting moral

Given a rotated shape, move the hyper plane and rotate the shape to identify it
Present all shapes as options. Give 2-3 minutes per shape
Select button to choose the shape, submit button the end the timer early.

Ask about their confidence after each shape. - avoid saying if they are right or wrong to avoid effecting moral
-->

## Survey 3
<!--
How did you feel you did

How confident are you that you were able to identify x shapes 3D counter part correctly
Comment about x shape: Did it behave how you expected.
 - after every shape?
-->

# Identify the Rotation
## Experiment
<!-- 
Have a shape continuously rotating in 1 axis, allow the user to move along the w axis
Give 2-3 minutes for the user to identify the shape

Have a shape continuously rotating in 2 axis, allow the user to move along the w axis
Give 2-3 minutes for the user to identify the shape

Do I get them to identify the rotation? is that to arbitrary?
-->

## Survey 4
<!--
How did you feel you did

How confident are you that you were able to identify x shapes 3D counter part correctly
 - after every shape?

Did the behaviour make sense? Do you feel you understood it?
 - after every shape?

Comments about why you think it behaved it did?
 - after every shape?
-->

# Match the pose
## Experiment
<!-- 
Have a 4D Shape on the left that is randomly rotated
Have a 4D shape on the right that is un-rotated
10-15mins to manipulate the shape to try and match the pose.

Skip button after 5 or 10 mins?
-->

## Survey 4
<!--
Do you know which shape you were manipulating?
 - after every shape?

How difficult did you find matching the pose
 - after every shape?

Comments: open question about how they found the task
