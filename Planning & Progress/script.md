# Introduction
## 4D Shapes

**Geometry**
<!-- Graphic of 3D axes -->
As I am sure you know, 3D Euclidean space is made up of 3 axes; x, y and z.
In 4D we have 4 axes, x, y, z and w. it is impossible to imagine, but the w axis is perpendicular to x and y and z, in the same way that z is perpendicular to x and y.

<!-- Tesseract graphic -->
Each dimension, brings a new perpendicular axis, but like I said we cannot visualise this properly. Rather than trying to visualise the 4D space, we will be viewing a 3D cross section of 4D objects.

<!-- 3D Sphere -->
To begin understanding 4D shapes, it is best to start with 3D examples.

Take a 3D sphere:

If we take a 2D slice at the center of that sphere, you can see it appears as a circle.

<!-- overlaid arrows to show axes -->
As I said before 3D space is described with 3 axes, x y and z. In this example, we take y to be up. In this case, the cross section covers a slice along the z axis and spans the x, y plane.

If we move that sphere, along the z axis, through the translucent plane, you can see the 2D circle changes size.

<!-- 3D Cube -->
Now we will take a 3D Cube:

If we move this cube through the plane, you can see it actually remains the same shape. That is until we get so far that the shape is no longer within the slice and disappears.

<!-- 4D Sphere -->
Moving on to 4D: 

Here we are taking a 3D cross section of a 4 Dimensional object, in this case a hyper sphere.

A hyper sphere has a radius spanning in all 4 axes. In 2D the radius spans x and y. in 3D it spans x and y and z. In 4D it spans X Y Z and W.

If we move the sphere forward or backward along the W axis, you can see it appears as a sphere that shrinks and expands, very similar to the circular 2D cross section of the 3D sphere.

<!-- 4D Cube -->
If we now take the 4D hyper cube also known as a tesseract.
A hyper cube is a cube extruded along the W axis, in the same way a cube is a square extruded along the Z axis.

You can see the hyper cube also behaves very similarly when we move it along the W axis as to when we moved a 3D cube along the Z axis.

**Rotation**
Moving on to 4D rotation.

<!-- Rotation Video -->
I am sure you are used to thinking of rotation an object as "rotating the object about an axis". For the sake of understand 4D rotation, you will need to adapt your understanding slightly. 

Instead: consider that we rotate an object around a plane.
For example: this would make rotating about the Y axis, equivalent to rotating about the XZ plane.

You can think of the rotation as rotating from 1 axis to another. So XZ rotation would be rotating from X to Z.

the 3 degrees of rotation in 3D would then be YZ, XZ, XY rather than X, Y and Z respectively.

<!-- QUICK Video of each degree - _W disapear-->
Now In 4D there are 6 degrees of rotation. The regular, Y to Z, X to Z, X to Y, plus X to W, Y to W and Z to W.

Whilst you should think of rotation in terms of rotating about a plane, it can help to keep axial rotation in mind. XW rotation can be similar to YZ rotation, and YZ rotation is equivalent to rotation about the X axis.

Lets look at the rotation of a cube.

<!-- Rotating 3D Cube -->
If we take a look at the 2D cross section of the 3D cube, we can get a hint at what will happen in 4D.

When rotating the cube along the XZ plane we can see the cross section looks like it gets wider and then retracts to a square again.

<!-- Rotating a 4D Cube -->
Now when we rotate the hyper cube along the XW plane, we can see it does more or less the same thing.

<!-- Rotating in multiple planes 4D Cube -->
If we rotate along multiple axes in 3D you can see it gets a bit confusing,

but it is still similar to that in 4D

<!-- Rotated 3D cube along W -->
You can see also, that a rotated cube in 3D will produce cross section that may not look like a square

<!-- Rotated 4D cube along W -->
Once again, the same principles apply to 4D

## The Experiment
<!--
Explain the series of tests
 - repeat the same tests 3 times for 3 different representations
 - Tests:
   - 1st - shape identification
     - given a shape that is randomly oriented, 
       can you tell me what that shape is?
     - 2 mins per shape
   - 2nd - rotation identification
     - given a shape that is rotating, can you tell me what plane 
       or planes of rotation the object is rotating around
     - 2 mins per shape
   - 3rd - matching an objects orientation
     - Given a randomly oriented object, can you match the objects 
       pose
     - Try get as close as possible before submitting
     - 6 mins per shape
 - Representations:
   - Control
     - Just a regular 4D Object
   - 3D to 4D
     - A 3D object in the bottom left that mimics XW, YW and ZW
       rotation by rotating on YZ, XZ and XY planes respectively
   - W axis Timeline
     - The central cross section is the focus of attention, but
       either side of the white object are red and blue objects, cross sections of the shape shape but stepped +/- 0.4 and +/- 0.8 into
       the 4th dimension, the further away from the central object it is
   - Multi-Rotational view of 4D object
     - In the top left is the regular 4D object.
     - On the right is the same object but viewed at a 90deg angle on the 
       XW plane
     - Under that, in the bottom right is the same object as the top left
       but rotated on the YW plane
     - To the left of that, in the bottom left is the same object as the   
       top left but rotated on the ZW plane
 - Texture
   - Through each test the object may be coloured in a different way.
     - diffuse lighting
     - RGBW with diffuse lighting
     - RGBW with pattern
     - Blue/Red +/-normal direction with pattern

 - Measurements
   - You will be measured on your speed and your accuracy but take your time. 
   - After testing each representation you will be shown your updated statistics.
   - BTS
     - Average for Representation:
       - Time to submit
         - normalised to max time per task
       - Accuracy
         - 0% OR 100% if select from options
         - 0% TO 100% for pose matching

Rights as a participant
-->

So as a participant it is important that you understand your rights

...

You will, if you choose to do so, be participating in a series of tests. These tests will be explained as and when they occur. You are free to stop the experiment at any time. Tests will be repeated for a series of different representations of 4D objects. The representation will be explained to you, prior to starting the next stage of testing. After each stage of testing, you will be shown a graph to indicate your performance between different representations.

## Survey 2
<!--
Note down anything you think you may not understand fully or think may be a challenge
-->

If there is anything you feel you may not understand, or may be a challenge for you, write it here:

## Representations

### Control - 4D Object

The representation of the 4D objects you will be interacting with for the next series of tests will be just a regular 3D cross section of a 4 dimensional object.

### 3D View

The representation of the 4D objects you will be interacting with for the next series of tests will be a 3D cross section of a 4 dimensional object, accompanied with a window showing (the analogous 3D version of the object) (a regular 3D cube). This 3D object will rotate along the 3D axis that best match the 4D planar rotations. For example, WX rotation will rotate the object about the X axis (about the YZ plane). The idea of this is to help you understand what rotations you make in 4D, as you make them.

### 4D Timeline

The representation of the 4D objects you will be interacting with for the next series of tests will be a 3D cross section of a 4 dimensional object, accompanied with 2 more cross sections either side of the main object. These cross sections are stepped forward and backward along the W axis. The idea of this is that it gives you a more in depth idea of the shape of the object.

### 4D Multi-view

The representation of the 4D objects you will be interacting with for the next series of tests will be a 3D cross section of a 4 dimensional object, accompanied with 3 more 4D objects. Each of the other 4D objects are rotated 90 degrees about each planar rotation towards W. That is - each cross section of the 4D object lets you view the same object from a different angle.

# Match the pose
## Experiment
<!-- 
Have a 4D Shape on the left that is randomly rotated
Have a 4D shape on the right that is un-rotated
10-15mins to manipulate the shape to try and match the pose.

Skip button after 5 or 10 mins?
-->

In this experiment you will have to match the 4D rotation of the object shown in the top left of your screen. Rotating along the YZ, XZ and XY planes (X, Y and Z axes) will also rotate the object in the top left. Therefore, your goal is to match the WX, WY and WZ rotation of your object, with the object shown in the top left of your screen.
