## Draft 1
<!-- state the general aim of the experiment -->
4 Dimensional objects are something that cannot be created physically and cannot be visualised in their true state. The motivation for this project is to further a persons understanding of high dimensional space and to test their understanding of geometry that cannot be wholely visualised.

The aim of this experiment is to investigate the different ways in which higher dimensional objects can be represented and to evaluate the effectiveness of these representations.

<!-- explain why you need the involvement of other people -->
Whilst developing the system I have become quite familiar with four dimensional objects. As such the representations that I believe are superior may not be as effective or intuitive when it comes to teaching others about higher dimensional geometry. I need you as a participant, along side others with varying experiences with geometry, to test out some of these representations to see if they really benefit ones understanding of higher dimensional shapes.

<!-- describe what will happen in the experiment -->
The experiment will begin with a tutorial video, briefly explaining the fourth dimension, four dimensional objects as well as how you manipulate these objects. The experiment is then broken down into stages. Each stage will present you with a new representation. There are four different representations in total and each will be explained to you before you have to use them. One of the representations is designed as a "Control" and does not provide any additional benefit. Each of the other three representation provide a piece of extra information to help you further understand the object you are handling. Whilst dealing with a representation you will be presented with a series of repeated tests. As with the representation, the rules of the test will be explained before they begin. Firstly you will have to identify the shape on your screen. You will be allowed to play with this object for a fixed amount of time, and you must submit your answer before the timer runs out. The second test will ask you to identify the way in which an object is rotating. It could be rotating on multiple axes. The final test will present you with a shape that is randomly oriented exclusively along the four dimensional planes of rotation (which will be described in the tutorial video). Your goal is to then match the orientation of your object with the randomly oriented one. After completing these tests for a representation, you will be shown a graph depicting your average accuracy for each test. Once each test has been completed for the representation, you will be progressed onto using another representation where you will complete the same tests.

<!-- describe what data will be collected -->
Collected data includes: time to submit and accuracy of submission, as well as the shape and rotations of any objects on screen. After each test you will be asked to fill out a short survey on paper describing how you felt that specific test went as well as any other information you choose to include.

<!-- explain what interaction the participant may have with you during the experiment -->
During the experiment I will leave you to complete the assigned challenges, however if you have any questions, I will be close by.

<!-- reassure the participant that this is not a test of ability -->
This experiment is not a test of your ability or intellect. It is purely an evaluation of the effectiveness of each included way to represent four dimensional objects. Some of these tasks can be very challenging, and you should not feel disheartened if you find it so.

<!-- state that the participant may withdraw at anytime -->
You as a participant may withdraw from the experiment at any time, even after it has began.

<!-- seek explicit consent -->
By clicking the continue button, you are consenting to the recording of your performance throughout these tests. If you decide that this data may not be used, whether that is after or during the experiment, the recorded data will be deleted. After the experiment you will be asked to sign a short form providing your explicit consent to use and analyse your data alongside that of other participants.

<!-- allow the participant to ask questions -->
You are allowed to ask questions at any time before, during and after the experiment.

Introduction

4 Dimensional objects are something that cannot be created physically and cannot be visualised in their true state. The motivation for this project is to try to further a persons understanding of higher dimensional space and to test their understanding of geometry that cannot be wholely visualised.

The aim of this experiment is to investigate the different ways in which higher dimensional objects can be represented and to evaluate the effectiveness of these representations.

The experiment will begin with a tutorial video, briefly explaining the fourth dimension, 4D objects as well as how you manipulate these objects. After watching the tutorial video you will be given a short amount of time to play around with a 4D Cube, before the tests begin.
There are 4 different representations in total and each will be explained to you before you have to use them. One of the representations is designed as a "Control" and does not provide any additional benefit. Each of the other three representation provide a piece of extra information to help you further understand the object you are handling. 
Whilst dealing with a representation you will be presented with a series of repeated tests. As with the representation, the rules of the test will be explained before it begins.  
After completing these tests for each representation, you will be shown a graph depicting your accuracy for each test.

Collected data includes the time to submit and accuracy of submission, as well as the shape and rotations of any objects on screen. After each test you will be asked to fill out a short survey describing how you felt that specific test went.

This experiment is not a test of your ability or intellect. It is an evaluation of the effectiveness of each included way to represent four dimensional objects. Some of these tasks can be very challenging, and you should not feel disheartened if you find it so.

As a participant you may withdraw from the experiment at any time, even after it has began.

By clicking the continue button, you are consenting to the recording of your performance throughout these tests. If you decide that this data may not be used, whether that is after or during the experiment, the recorded data will be deleted. After the experiment you will be asked to sign a short form providing your explicit consent to use and analyse your data alongside that of other participants.

You are allowed to ask questions at any time before, during and after the experiment.
You are provided with a sheet of paper to draw or note anything down that you think may be of value.

When you click the "continue to tutorial" button, a video will play that will try to explain the concept of 4D shapes. You can pause and rewind this video at any time.


## Draft 3

The motivation for this project is to try to further understanding of 4D space and to test understanding of geometry that cannot be directly visualised.

The experiment will begin with a tutorial video, briefly explaining the fourth dimension, and show you how to manipulate these objects. After watching the tutorial video you will be given a short demo to play with a 4D Cube. The experiment is broken down into stages. Each stage will be explained to you before you start it.

Collected data includes the time to submit and accuracy of submission, as well as the shape and rotations of any objects on screen. After each test you will be asked to fill out a short survey.

You may withdraw from the experiment at any time. You may ask questions at any time. This experiment is not a test of your ability or intellect. Some of these tasks can be challenging, and you should not feel disheartened if you find it so.

# Introduction
## 4D Shapes

**Geometry**
<!-- Graphic of 3D axes -->
As I am sure you know, 3D Euclidean space is made up of 3 axes; x, y and z.
In 4D we have 4 axes, x, y, z and w. it is impossible to imagine, but the w axis is perpendicular to x and y and z, in the same way that z is perpendicular to x and y.

<!-- Tesseract graphic -->
Each dimension, brings a new perpendicular axis, but like I said we cannot visualise this properly. Rather than trying to visualise the 4D space, we will be viewing a 3D cross section of 4D objects.

<!-- 3D Sphere -->
To begin understanding 4D shapes, it is best to start with 3D examples.

Take a 3D sphere:

If we take a 2D slice at the center of that sphere, you can see it appears as a circle.

<!-- overlaid arrows to show axes -->
As I said before 3D space is described with 3 axes, x y and z. In this example, we take y to be up. In this case, the cross section covers a slice along the z axis and spans the x, y plane.

If we move that sphere, along the z axis, through the translucent plane, you can see the 2D circle changes size.

<!-- 3D Cube -->
Now we will take a 3D Cube:

If we move this cube through the plane, you can see it actually remains the same shape. That is until we get so far that the shape is no longer within the slice and disappears.

<!-- 4D Sphere -->
Moving on to 4D: 

Here we are taking a 3D cross section of a 4 Dimensional object, in this case a hyper sphere.

A hyper sphere has a radius spanning in all 4 axes. In 2D the radius spans x and y. in 3D it spans x and y and z. In 4D it spans X Y Z and W.

If we move the sphere forward or backward along the W axis, you can see it appears as a sphere that shrinks and expands, very similar to the circular 2D cross section of the 3D sphere.

<!-- 4D Cube -->
If we now take the 4D hyper cube also known as a tesseract.
A hyper cube is a cube extruded along the W axis, in the same way a cube is a square extruded along the Z axis.

You can see the hyper cube also behaves very similarly when we move it along the W axis as to when we moved a 3D cube along the Z axis.

**Rotation**
Moving on to 4D rotation.

<!-- Rotation Video -->
I am sure you are used to thinking of rotation an object as "rotating the object about an axis". For the sake of understand 4D rotation, you will need to adapt your understanding slightly. 

Instead: consider that we rotate an object around a plane.
For example: this would make rotating about the Y axis, equivalent to rotating about the XZ plane.

You can think of the rotation as rotating from 1 axis to another. So XZ rotation would be rotating from X to Z.

the 3 degrees of rotation in 3D would then be YZ, XZ, XY rather than X, Y and Z respectively.

<!-- QUICK Video of each degree - _W disapear-->
Now In 4D there are 6 degrees of rotation. The regular, Y to Z, X to Z, X to Y, plus X to W, Y to W and Z to W.

Whilst you should think of rotation in terms of rotating about a plane, it can help to keep axial rotation in mind. XW rotation can be similar to YZ rotation, and YZ rotation is equivalent to rotation about the X axis.

Lets look at the rotation of a cube.

---

<!-- Rotating 3D Cube --
If we take a look at the 2D cross section of the 3D cube, we can get a hint at what will happen in 4D.

When rotating the cube along the XZ plane we can see the cross section looks like it gets wider and then retracts to a square again.

<!-- Rotating a 4D Cube --
Now when we rotate the hyper cube along the XW plane, we can see it does more or less the same thing.

<!-- Rotating in multiple planes 4D Cube --
If we rotate along multiple axes in 3D you can see it gets a bit confusing,

but it is still similar to that in 4D

<!-- Rotated 3D cube along W --
You can see also, that a rotated cube in 3D will produce cross section that may not look like a square

<!-- Rotated 4D cube along W --
Once again, the same principles apply to 4D

---

<!-- Rotate along XZ -->
If we rotate the cube along the XZ plane it can be considered a rotation within 2 dimensional space

Within 2 dimensional rotation, the object stays the same size and shape

<!-- 3D rotation -->
If we rotate the cube along either the XY or YZ planes, the object rotates within 3 dimensional space. Because of this, the 2D cross section changes size or shape

<!-- 3D rotation of 4D object -->
Rotating a 4D object in 3D space leads to the rotations we are familiar with
3D space includes the XY, XZ and YZ planes

<!-- 4D rotation of a 4D object -->
however when we rotate the hyper cube in 4D space, it changes size or shape in a very similar way as to the 2D cross section of a 3D cube rotating in 3D space

4 dimensional rotations include the XW, YW and ZW planes

<!-- Multiple Rotations -->
When rotating a 3D cube in 3D planes of rotation, the shape of the cross section changes further. The same concepts apply in 4D with multiple planes of 4D rotation

## The Experiment

Rights as a participant
-->

So as a participant it is important that you understand your rights

...

You will, if you choose to do so, be participating in a series of tests. These tests will be explained as and when they occur. You are free to stop the experiment at any time. Tests will be repeated for a series of different representations of 4D objects. The representation will be explained to you, prior to starting the next stage of testing. After each stage of testing, you will be shown a graph to indicate your performance between different representations.

## Survey 2
<!--
Note down anything you think you may not understand fully or think may be a challenge
-->

If there is anything you feel you may not understand, or may be a challenge for you, write it here:

## Representations

### Control - 4D Object

The representation of the 4D objects you will be interacting with for the next series of tests will be just a regular 3D cross section of a 4 dimensional object.

### 3D View

The representation of the 4D objects you will be interacting with for the next series of tests will be a 3D cross section of a 4 dimensional object, accompanied with a window showing (the analogous 3D version of the object) (a regular 3D cube). This 3D object will rotate along the 3D axis that best match the 4D planar rotations. For example, WX rotation will rotate the object about the X axis (about the YZ plane). The idea of this is to help you understand what rotations you make in 4D, as you make them.

### 4D Timeline

The representation of the 4D objects you will be interacting with for the next series of tests will be a 3D cross section of a 4 dimensional object, accompanied with 2 more cross sections either side of the main object. These cross sections are stepped forward and backward along the W axis. The idea of this is that it gives you a more in depth idea of the shape of the object.

### 4D Multi-view

The representation of the 4D objects you will be interacting with for the next series of tests will be a 3D cross section of a 4 dimensional object, accompanied with 3 more 4D objects. Each of the other 4D objects are rotated 90 degrees about each planar rotation towards W. That is - each cross section of the 4D object lets you view the same object from a different angle.

# Identify the shape

# Match the pose
## Experiment
<!--

Skip button after 5 or 10 mins?
-->

In this experiment you will have to match the 4D rotation of the object shown in the top left of your screen. Rotating along the YZ, XZ and XY planes (X, Y and Z axes) will also rotate the object in the top left. Therefore, your goal is to match the WX, WY and WZ rotation of your object, with the object shown in the top left of your screen.
