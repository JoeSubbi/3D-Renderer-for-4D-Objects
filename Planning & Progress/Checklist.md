# Invite

Hey everyone! I am looking for people to participate in an experiment for my 4th year project about 4D shapes.

The goal of the experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of a series of representations of 4D objects.
In the experiment you will have to complete a series of challenges involving 4D shapes, from guessing the shape to matching the orientation of two 4D objects.

The experiment will be run online and should take at most 1.5 hours but generally it should be closer to 1 hour.

If you are interested just check your browser that supports WebGL: https://get.webgl.org/
and you can book a time slot with me here https://calendly.com/joe-subbiani/4d-shapes-experiment or email me at 2377990s@student.gla.ac.uk or message me on discord
