# Semester 1
## 07/10/2021

Rudy Rucker - 4D book

Philosophy and psychological approach to higher dimensional understanding

Inigo Quilez - Creator of *Shader Toy*
https://www.iquilezles.org/index.html

try get most done by week 7 as assessed exercises will reduce time to work on project

## 14/10/2021

how do you prove that someone has understood the geometry?

look into exp/log map rotation - expandable to multiple dimensions

## 22/10/2021

Give Rotors sense of direction by multiplying with a vector

## 04/11/2021

How to decide whether to use certain representations
 - 10 different ideas - informal trial  
 - 3 winners and more in-depth study  
   - even if just asking some friends

User interaction
 - geodesic - representation of the surface by shortest path
 - project touch onto a sphere to rotate between pos1 and pos2 vectors

## 18/11/2021

Consider different textural visualisations

Within groups testing
 - have each user try multiple representations

Show user progress between each representation

## 25/11/2021

rotation is something to do preliminary tests with, if one is clearly better pick that

pick and choose what to experiment on. What is the question I am trying to answer

textures - can be simple or complex, as long as it is easy for a user to find a landmark

## 02/12/2021

john will take a look at rotors

probably set end of december as deadline for rotors

## 09/12/2021

discussion of plan for next term

more discussion about rotors

## 13/01/2021

angle between rotors - just take dot product of random vectors rotated by the 2 rotors DUHHH...

experiments - try an online thing - webGL or screen share

discussion of road map - make as much time as possible so i don't loose time with AEs etc

length of test - 50minutes best for an hour slot - don't spend too much time in experiment

## 20/01/2021

don't email entire university

port is blocked on eduroam - use copy to clipboard as backup

have tutorial as youtube video if not working on itch.io

proper analysis with some analysis tools before opening experiment applications

### 27/01/2021

do not need proofs - just explain laws of geometric algebra and derivation using sympy
 - anti commute, add multivectors etc

include code/algorithm for ray marching

rule of thumb - write word for numbers if < 12 (except for abbreviations like 4D)

Summer directory has no use - its old
