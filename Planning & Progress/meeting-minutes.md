# Semester 1
## 07/10/2021

Rudy Rucker - 4D book

Philosophy and psychological approach to higher dimensional understanding

Inigo Quilez - Creator of *Shader Toy*
https://www.iquilezles.org/index.html

try get most done by week 7 as assessed exercises will reduce time to work on project

## 14/10/2021

how do you prove that someone has understood the geometry?

look into exp/log map rotation - expandable to multiple dimensions

## 22/10/2021

Give Rotors sense of direction by multiplying with a vector

## 04/11/2021

How to decide whether to use certain representations
 - 10 different ideas - informal trial  
 - 3 winners and more in-depth study  
   - even if just asking some friends

User interaction
 - geodesic - representation of the surface by shortest path
 - project touch onto a sphere to rotate between pos1 and pos2 vectors

## 18/11/2021

Consider different textural visualisations

Within groups testing
 - have each user try multiple representations

Show user progress between each representation

## 25/11/2021

rotation is something to do preliminary tests with, if one is clearly better pick that

pick and choose what to experiment on. What is the question I am trying to answer

textures - can be simple or complex, as long as it is easy for a user to find a landmark

## 02/12/2021

john will take a look at rotors

probably set end of december as deadline for rotors

## 09/12/2021

discussion of plan for next term

more discussion about rotors

## 13/01/2022

angle between rotors - just take dot product of random vectors rotated by the 2 rotors DUHHH...

experiments - try an online thing - webGL or screen share

discussion of road map - make as much time as possible so i don't loose time with AEs etc

length of test - 50minutes best for an hour slot - don't spend too much time in experiment

## 20/01/2022

don't email entire university

port is blocked on eduroam - use copy to clipboard as backup

have tutorial as youtube video if not working on itch.io

proper analysis with some analysis tools before opening experiment applications

### 27/01/2022

do not need proofs - just explain laws of geometric algebra and derivation using sympy
 - anti commute, add multivectors etc

include code/algorithm for ray marching

rule of thumb - write word for numbers if < 12 (except for abbreviations like 4D)

Summer directory has no use - its old

### 03/02/2022

try take multiple random vectors and take the average minimum angle between rotated vectors

### 10/02/2022

don't delve to deep into data due to not enough of it
 - mention stuff i would like to explore but couldn't

can send bits of dissertation whenever

### 18/02/2022

aims:
 - list research questions
 - discussion of potential implication of results

evaluation
 - discussion of implication of results
 - 0.5-1 page tie into aims

background
 - argue other peoples work
   - good and bad - limitations etc

motivation
 - being able to understand 4D
   - very high nD spaces - lots of corners short distance apart
   - some things just don't behave as intuition predicts
   - introduction without being to jarring to new people
 - interactive exploration - value of learning this way
 - bringing intuition of 3D world to 4D

to get high grade
 - good argument throughout whole dissertation and in evaluation
 - good questions
 - good presentation of results and their implications
 - implementation - credit for everything that I have done (they wont look at source code)
 - high quality diagrams
 - do not jump from high level to implementation
