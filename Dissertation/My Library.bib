an object in a four-dimensional (4D) space are simultaneously projected onto multiple three-dimensional (3D) screens created in a
virtual environment to reveal its intricate shape. The understanding
of high-dimensional shapes and data can essentially be enhanced
when good visualization is complemented by interactive functionality. However, a method to implement an interface for handling
complex 4D transformations in a user-friendly manner must be developed. Using our Polyvision system, the user can manipulate each
shadow as if it were a 3D object in their hand. The user’s action on
each projection is reflected to the original 4D object, and in turn its
projections, in real time. While controlling the object’s orientation
minutely on one shadow, the user can grasp its global structure
from multiple changing projections. Our system has a wide variety of applications in visualization, education, mathematical research,
and entertainment, as we demonstrate with a variety of 4D objects
that appear in mathematics and data sciences.},

One fundamental problem is that manipulation of 3D objects with 2D user interfaces is very difficult for nonexperienced users.In this paper, we introduce a new system that uses constraints to restrict object motion in a 3D scene, making interaction much simpler and more intuitive. We compare three different 3D scene manipulation techniques based on a 2D user interface. We show that the presented techniques are significantly more efficient than commonly used solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of 3D manipulation techniques with 2D devices and constraints.},

	abstract = {Existing interaction techniques for mobile AR often use the multi-touch capabilities of the device's display for object selection and manipulation. To provide full 3D manipulation by touch in an integral way, existing approaches use complex multi finger and hand gestures. However, they are difficult or impossible to use in one-handed handheld AR scenarios and their usage requires prior knowledge. Furthermore, a handheld's touch screen offers only two dimensions for interaction and limits manipulation to physical screen size. To overcome these problems, we present two novel intuitive six degree-of-freedom (6DOF) manipulation techniques, 3DTouch and HOMER-S. While 3DTouch uses only simple touch gestures and decomposes the degrees of freedom, Homer-S provides full 6DOF and is decoupled from screen input to overcome physical limitations. In a comprehensive user study, we explore performance, usability and accuracy of both techniques. Therefore, we compare 3DTouch with HOMER-S in four different scenarios with varying transformation requirements. Our results reveal both techniques to be intuitive to translate and rotate objects. HOMER-S lacks accuracy compared to 3DTouch but achieves significant performance increases in terms of speed for transformations addressing all 6DOF.},

	abstract = {A method to visualize polytopes in a four-dimensional euclidian space (x, y, z, w) is proposed. A polytope is sliced by multiple hyperplanes that are parallel to each other and separated by uniform intervals. Since the hyperplanes are perpendicular to the w-axis, the resulting multiple slices appear in the three-dimensional (x, y, z) space and they are shown by the standard computer graphics. The polytope is rotated extrinsically in the four-dimensional space by means of a simple input method based on keyboard typings. The multiple slices are placed on a parabola curve in the three-dimensional world coordinates. The slices in a view window form an oval appearance. Both the simple and the double rotations in the four-dimensional space are applied to the polytope. All slices synchronously change their shapes when a rotation is applied to the polytope. The compact display in the oval of many slices with the help of quick rotations facilitate a grasp of the four-dimensional configuration of the polytope.},

Analogs of 3D shading methods are used to produce volume renderings that distinguish objects whose 3D projections from 4D are identical.

Because the use of RST has thus far focused almost entirely on 2D, there are not yet standard techniques for extending these principles into three dimensions. In this paper we describe a screen-space method which fully captures the semantics of the traditional 2D RST multi-touch interaction, but also allows us to extend these same principles into three-dimensional (3D) interaction. Just like RST allows users to directly manipulate 2D contexts with two or more points, our method allows the user to directly manipulate 3D objects with three or more points. We show some novel interactions, which take perspective into account and are thus not available in orthographic environments. Furthermore, we identify key ambiguities and unexpected behaviors that arise when performing direct manipulation in 3D and offer solutions to mitigate the difficulties each presents. Finally, we show how to extend our method to meet application-specific control objectives, as well as show our method working in some example environments.},

The system is composed of a motion capture device, a large screen, a stereo viewing system and a graphics workstation. In this environment, a user can go around the 4D world freely and interact with 4D data.

The system can display four types of 4D data including 4D solid objects, 3D scalar potential fields, the profile of the complex function and 3D time-series data. Two mapping methods are employed to generate corresponding 3D images: They are the projection from 4D space to 3D space and the 3D section of 4D data.

The user can observe the 4D object from an arbitrary 4D viewpoint and slice it from an arbitrary 4D direction by matching his 3D position to the point which lies on the surface of the 4D sphere surrounding the object. Moreover, using stereo glasses and position sensors attached to each hand, the user can easily rotate the 3D shape mapped from 4D space.

As a result of evaluation, it was proved that the interaction with 4D data is effective for intuitive understanding of 4D.},
